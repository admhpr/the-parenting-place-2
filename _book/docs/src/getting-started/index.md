### Getting Started

The `Sectional` Theme aims to provide a flexible and easy way to build pages from sections within Wordpress v4.9 <=.

## Create a Page

In `Sectional` Pages are viewed differently than posts. Each page is made up from sections.
They represent blocks or the rows of the page.

By design each page _MUST_ have a `banner` section, without this the page will not render correctly.

All other sections apart from that are optional.

## Available Sections

```
├── banner
├── block
├── blog
├── box
├── card
├── events
├── gallery
├── image
├── slider
└── text
```

### How to Add a Section
